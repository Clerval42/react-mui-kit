# React UI Library with MUI & Tailwind

This library provides a set of customizable React UI components built with Material-UI (MUI) and styled using Tailwind CSS. It is designed for rapid development, flexibility, and easy theming.

## Features
- Built with [MUI](https://mui.com/) for accessibility and robust UI primitives
- Styled and extended with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Easy-to-use variants and props for customization
- All components are fully compatible with MUI and can be used alongside classic MUI components

## Installation

```
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled clsx
# and Tailwind CSS if not already installed
```

## Usage
Import the components you need from your library:

```jsx
import { Buttonmc, Alertmc, Cardmc, Inputmc, Modalmc, Badgemc, Avatarmc } from './components';
```

## Components & Variants

### Buttonmc
A button with MUI logic and Tailwind styling.

```

```

### Modalmc

</Modalmc>
```

### Badgemc
Badge for icons, avatars, or any element. Supports color and dot/standard variants.

```

### Avatarmc

## Customization
- All components accept a `className` prop for further Tailwind or custom styling.
- You can use any MUI prop supported by the underlying component.
- Variants and sizes are extensibleâ€”edit the component files to add more!

## Classic MUI Usage
You can still use classic MUI components directly if you want full control or need features not exposed by this library.
